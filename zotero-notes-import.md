# Zotero Notes Import

Imports structured HTML reading notes into Zotero as item notes, matching each entry to its Zotero item via author + year. Preserves personal annotation sections separately from PDF summary sections.

Notes are written via the **Zotero Web API** (not SQLite) so that keys are server-generated, sync state is correct, and Zotero can remain open during import.

Input is an **HTML outliner export** (e.g. File → Export → HTML from Bike or similar outliners). The nested `<ul>/<li>` structure is parsed directly.

---

## ⚠️ MANDATORY FIRST STEP — API credentials

**Before doing anything else**, check whether the user has already provided their Zotero credentials in this session. If yes, skip this step. If not, use the AskUserQuestion tool to ask:

```
Question: "Do you have your Zotero API key and numeric user ID ready?"

Options:
  A. "Yes — I'll paste them now"
  B. "No — I need to get them first"
```

If B: direct the user to https://www.zotero.org/settings/keys. The API key needs **read/write** access to their personal library and any group libraries. The **numeric userID** appears on that same page as "Your userID for use in API calls is XXXXXXX".

---

## Input

- **Notes file**: an HTML outliner export (e.g. from Bike: File → Save As… → HTML; hold the Option key when opening the File menu to expose the Save As command). Ask the user to export and copy the file to their Zotero folder (`~/Zotero/`), then provide the filename.
- **Zotero database**: opened read-only for item matching and group ID lookup.

---

## Process

### Step 1 — Parse the HTML outliner export

Read the HTML file. Outliners like Bike export a nested `<ul>/<li>` structure where each `<li>` contains a `<p>` and optionally a child `<ul>`.

Detect paper `<li>` elements by scanning **all `<li>` elements** recursively.

The recommended reference style is **Methods in Ecology & Evolution (MEE)**, which always includes a DOI. A typical entry looks like:

```
Smith, J., Brown, A., & Lee, K. (2021). Title of the paper. Journal Name,
590, 261–264. https://doi.org/10.xxxx/xxxxx
```

Detection relies on two signals that are always present in a well-formed MEE reference: a four-digit year in parentheses, and a DOI hyperlink (or an italicised journal name for references without a DOI). Author names need not be bold — the parser extracts the last name as the text before the first comma in the `<p>`.

```python
import re
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def is_paper_li(li):
    first_p = li.find('p')
    if not first_p:
        return False
    text = first_p.get_text()
    if not re.search(r'\(\d{4}\)', text):               # must have year in parens
        return False
    if not (first_p.find('a') or first_p.find('em')):  # must have DOI link or journal name
        return False
    return True

with open(notes_file, encoding='utf-8') as f:
    soup = BeautifulSoup(f, 'html.parser')

paper_lis = [li for li in soup.find_all('li') if is_paper_li(li)]
```

From the first `<p>` of each paper `<li>`, extract:
- **Last name**: text before the first comma in the `<p>`, stripped of leading whitespace. For multi-author entries this is the first author's last name.
- **Year**: four-digit year in parentheses.

The **child `<ul>`** of each paper `<li>` contains the note body. Identify **personal annotation items** by recursively scanning **all descendant `<li>` elements** (not just direct children). Any `<li>` whose first `<p>` text matches `^\s*LABEL\b` (case-insensitive word boundary, where LABEL is the user's annotation label) is a personal annotation item. This covers section headers ("NOTES", "NOTES summary", "NOTES upshot", "NOTES:") and inline notes at any nesting depth ("NOTES: but this paper uses a different metric."). All other `<li>` elements are non-personal (PDF-summary) content.

Ask the user what label they use for their personal annotation sections (e.g. initials like "DY", "JRS", or a word like "NOTES", "MY NOTES") if not already known.

Use `split_content` to recursively partition the tree, extracting personal annotation items from wherever they appear:

```python
def is_personal_li(li, label):
    first_p = li.find('p')
    return bool(first_p and re.match(rf'^\s*{re.escape(label)}\b', first_p.get_text(), re.IGNORECASE))

def split_content(li_list, label):
    """Recursively split <li> elements into personal and non-personal.
    Personal <li>s (and their children) go to the personal block.
    Within non-personal <li>s, recurse to extract any buried personal items.
    Returns (personal_lis, nopersonal_lis).
    """
    personal_lis, nopersonal_lis = [], []
    for li in li_list:
        if is_personal_li(li, label):
            personal_lis.append(li)
        else:
            child_ul = li.find('ul')
            if child_ul:
                child_lis = child_ul.find_all('li', recursive=False)
                sub_personal, _ = split_content(child_lis, label)
                for sub_li in sub_personal:
                    sub_li.extract()   # remove from tree so non-personal HTML stays clean
                personal_lis.extend(sub_personal)
            nopersonal_lis.append(li)
    return personal_lis, nopersonal_lis

child_ul = paper_li.find('ul')
if child_ul:
    top_lis = child_ul.find_all('li', recursive=False)
    personal_items, nopersonal_items = split_content(top_lis, label)
else:
    personal_items, nopersonal_items = [], []
```

### Step 2 — Build the library ID map via SQLite (read-only)

Open the Zotero SQLite database read-only. Use it for two things: item matching, and mapping SQLite `libraryID` → real Zotero group ID (these are not the same number).

```python
import sqlite3, glob, os

candidates = glob.glob('/sessions/*/mnt/Zotero/zotero.sqlite')
LIVE_DB = candidates[0] if candidates else os.path.expanduser('~/Zotero/zotero.sqlite')
conn = sqlite3.connect(f"file:{LIVE_DB}?mode=ro", uri=True)

# Build libraryID → API prefix map
# libraryID=1 is always the personal library
# All others are groups — their real group ID is in the `groups` table
lib_prefix = {1: f"/users/{ZOTERO_USER_ID}"}
for group_id, lib_id in conn.execute("SELECT groupID, libraryID FROM groups"):
    lib_prefix[lib_id] = f"/groups/{group_id}"
```

### Step 3 — Match each reference to Zotero items

```python
query = '''
SELECT i.itemID, i.key, i.libraryID,
       idv_title.value AS title,
       idv_year.value  AS year
FROM items i
JOIN itemCreators ic  ON ic.itemID   = i.itemID AND ic.orderIndex = 0
JOIN creators c       ON c.creatorID = ic.creatorID
LEFT JOIN itemData    id_year  ON id_year.itemID  = i.itemID
    AND id_year.fieldID  = (SELECT fieldID FROM fields WHERE fieldName = 'date')
LEFT JOIN itemDataValues idv_year  ON idv_year.valueID  = id_year.valueID
LEFT JOIN itemData    id_title ON id_title.itemID = i.itemID
    AND id_title.fieldID = (SELECT fieldID FROM fields WHERE fieldName = 'title')
LEFT JOIN itemDataValues idv_title ON idv_title.valueID = id_title.valueID
WHERE c.lastName LIKE ?
  AND idv_year.value LIKE ?
  AND i.itemTypeID NOT IN (14, 26)
'''

results = conn.execute(query, (f'%{last_name}%', f'{year}%')).fetchall()

# Deduplicate by itemID
seen = set()
deduped = []
for r in results:
    if r[0] not in seen:
        seen.add(r[0])
        deduped.append(r)
results = deduped
```

- **No match**: record as unmatched, continue.
- **One or more matches**: post note for every matched item (papers often exist as duplicates across collections/libraries).

Close connection when done:

```python
conn.close()
```

### Step 4 — Compose the note HTML

```html
<div class="zotero-note znv1">
  <p><strong>Reading notes</strong> — [first 200 chars of reference]</p>
  <ul>
    <!-- non-personal child <li> items, preserving nested structure -->
  </ul>

  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Personal notes</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <!-- personal annotation child <li> items -->
  </ul>
</div>
```

Omit `<hr/>` and personal block if no personal annotation items. Omit summary `<ul>` if no non-personal items. Strip `id`, `data-created`, `data-modified` attributes. Preserve `<strong>`, `<em>`, `<mark>`.

### Step 5 — Post via Web API

Always insert a new note, even if other notes already exist on the item.

```python
import requests, time

BASE    = "https://api.zotero.org"
HEADERS = {"Zotero-API-Key": ZOTERO_API_KEY, "Zotero-API-Version": "3"}

def post_note(prefix, item_key, note_html):
    payload = [{"itemType": "note", "parentItem": item_key,
                "note": note_html, "tags": [], "relations": {}}]
    r = requests.post(f"{BASE}{prefix}/items",
                      headers={**HEADERS, "Content-Type": "application/json"},
                      json=payload)
    if r.status_code not in (200, 201):
        raise RuntimeError(f"API error for {item_key}: {r.status_code} {r.text}")
    return r.json()

for item_id, item_key, lib_id, title, year in matched_items:
    prefix = lib_prefix.get(lib_id)
    if prefix is None:
        # unknown library — skip
        continue
    try:
        post_note(prefix, item_key, note_html)
        record_inserted(item_key)
    except requests.HTTPError as e:
        code = e.response.status_code
        if code == 403:
            record_permission_denied(item_key, prefix)
        elif code in (400, 404):
            # Stale SQLite entry: key exists locally but not on the server
            # (deleted, merged, or not yet synced). Log and continue.
            record_error(item_key, f"{code}: {e.response.text[:80]}")
        else:
            raise
    time.sleep(0.15)
```

### Step 6 — Generate a uv-compatible script and save to ~/Zotero/

Rather than running the import directly (the sandbox cannot reach api.zotero.org), generate a self-contained Python script with a PEP 723 inline metadata header and save it to `~/Zotero/zotero_note_import.py`. The user runs it locally with `uv run ~/Zotero/zotero_note_import.py`.

The script header must be:

```python
# /// script
# requires-python = ">=3.11"
# dependencies = ["requests", "beautifulsoup4"]
# ///
```

The script should be fully self-contained: credentials, note HTML, and targets all embedded. Note: the script always inserts — re-running will create duplicate notes. If you need idempotent re-runs, filter the targets list to only items that were not yet inserted in the previous run.

Tell the user:

```
Run with:
  uv run ~/Zotero/zotero_note_import.py

Then sync Zotero (Cmd+Shift+S).
```

### Step 7 — Report

After generating the script, report what will be imported:

| Status | Count | Papers |
|--------|-------|--------|
| ✓ Will insert note | N | [list of author–year + item key] |
| ✗ No Zotero match found | N | [full reference] |
| ✗ Library not in group map | N | [list] |
| ✗ 403 Permission denied | N | [list] |
| ✗ 400/404 Stale key | N | Key in local SQLite but absent from server (deleted/merged item) |

For unmatched papers, print the full reference so the user can investigate manually.

---

## After import

> Run `uv run ~/Zotero/zotero_note_import.py`, then sync Zotero (Cmd+Shift+S). Notes will appear on the relevant items in whichever library they belong to. If a note seems missing, check that your API key has write access to the relevant group library at https://www.zotero.org/settings/keys.

## How manuscript-audit uses these notes

The manuscript-audit skill queries notes as a secondary source during Stage 1 (citation faithfulness):

```python
notes = conn.execute(
    "SELECT note FROM itemNotes WHERE parentItemID = ?",
    (matched_item_id,)
).fetchall()
```

Parse the note HTML to separate:
- **PDF summary sections** (before `<hr/>`) — secondary source, confirm against PDF.
- **Personal annotation section** (after `<hr/>`) — personal opinions, not faithful to source; exclude from faithfulness verdicts but surface as context.

```
Notes (from Zotero — secondary source, confirm against PDF):
  [Relevant excerpt from PDF summary section]

Personal context (use-case notes — not faithful to source):
  [Relevant excerpt from personal annotation section]
```
